## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Renamed `staker_address` to `staking_provider_address` in `NodeMetadataPayload` fields and `RevocationOrder::new` parameters. ([#10])
- Renamed `NodeMetadataPayload.decentralized_identity_evidence` to `operator_signature`. ([#10])
- Declared `NodeMetadataPayload.operator_signature` as `recoverable::Signature` instead of just a byte array. This allows the user to detect an invalid signature on `NodeMetadata` creation. ([#11])
- Declared `NodeMetadataPayload.certificate_bytes` as `X509Certificate` instead of just a byte array. Also renamed it to `certificate`. Bindings take/return bytes, and expose a byte-typed `certificate_der` field. ([#12])

## [0.0.4] - 2022-02-09

### Changed

- Changed "worker" to "operator" in the API, according to the new terminology. ([#5])


[#5]: https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher-core/pull/5

## [0.0.3] - 2022-02-03

### Fixed

- Added the manifest to the Python bindings package, fixing the source distribution build.


## [0.0.2] - 2022-01-25

### Changed

- `umbral-pre` dependency bumped to 0.5 (and to match it, MSRV to 1.56, and Rust edition to 2021). The API was updated accordingly (mainly due to the no-clone approach). Note that this changes the ABI as well. ([#4])
- `NodeMetadataPayload.decentralized_identity_evidence` is now a fixed-sized array in the serialized metadata. ([#2])
- `k256` dependency bumped to 0.10, and `umbral-pre` to 0.5. ([#2])
- `NodeMetadataPayload.canonical_address` and the parameter `ursula_address` of `RevocationOrder::new()` are renamed to `staker_address`. ([#2])


### Added

- WASM bindings. ([#1])
- `NodeMetadataPayload::derive_worker_address()` method. ([#2])
